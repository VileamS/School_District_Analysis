# Results
    . District summary is affected by the students in grade 9th because we replaced it with NaN.
    . School summary is affected by the percentage of math, reading, overall passsing score.
    . When we replace 9th graders math and reading scores at Thomas High School, it affect the school performance by missing out on some of the 9th graders that are passing bot math and reading.
    . Replacing the 9th graders scores are affecting alot of the data by the school size are smaller and the same goes for school type and school spending.
